# Potato Late Blight Meta-analysis (Data Repository)

This repository contains the dataset compiled for the systematic review and meta-analysis of predictive models for potato late blight (*Phytophthora infestans*).

The Excel file `potato-late-blight-metadata.xlsx` includes raw and processed data, heterogeneity calculations, and classification schemes used in the analyses.

## File structure

### Sheets included
- **extract_methodology**: Notes on methodology for data extraction.  
- **data**: Raw data extracted from included studies (accuracy, fungicide reduction, and other outcomes).  
- **Heterogeneity calculation**: Step-by-step calculations used to estimate variance and standard errors for heterogeneity metrics.  
- **Heterogeneity values**: Final values of Q, I² and related metrics.  
- **data for classification**: Organized dataset prepared for classification of models.  
- **data for consistency**: Data subset prepared for consistency checks.  
- **data standard for consistency**: Standardized version of the consistency dataset.  
- **Country and region**: Mapping of studies to countries and geographic regions.  
- **Country x model**: Cross-tabulation of models by country.  
- **methodology_mechanisism**: Classification of models by mechanism (empirical, semi-mechanistic, mechanistic).  
- **Biorregions for classification**: Classification of studies according to bioregions.  

## Usage
- The dataset can be used to reproduce the meta-analysis reported in the manuscript.  
- Scripts for heterogeneity, classification, and funnel plot analyses are provided separately.
